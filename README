This repository is an Yii extension for adding the google plusone button to website pages.

It was created based on the facebook-opengraph which is a more complex extension (a wrapper for the Facebook
PHP SDK class) developed by Evan Johnson <thaddeusmt - A T - gmail.com> and available at his github site on 
http://github.com/splashlab/yii-facebook-opengraph.

////////////////////////////////////////////// INSTALLATION //////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Create a folder named yii-google-plusone into YOUR_PROJECT/protected/extensions/
2. Copy both files GPluginBase.php and GPlusoneButton.php into it.

You are ready to go!

///////////////////////////////////////////////// USAGE //////////////////////////////////////////////////

Render Google Plusone Plugin using helper Yii widgets:

<?php
$this->widget('ext.yii-google-plusone.GPlusoneButton', array(
  	      'width'=>'290',
	      'annotation'=>'inline',
	      'href'=>'YOUR_DOMAIN',
	      'lang'=>'es_ES'
));
?>

You can adapt the parameters to your needs (width, language, annotation and href).

I hope you can use this extension as it's a very simple way of including Goolge +1 to your site.
